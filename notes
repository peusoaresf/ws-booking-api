notes

> Node/Js version and config

// Unfortunately no import/export :(
// I tried for a while to configure it to work with both serverless framework and jest, but JS was'nt being nice to me xD
// I usually use import/export when writing typescript code, because it kind of comes bundled with it, and javascript usually
// is in the style used in this repo.
// Not to say that there isn't any modern syntax, cause I try to use at least async/await, spread and destructuring as much as possible.

> Database

// I decided to go with dynamo as db because it allows rapid prototyping and testing (cause of the no sql nature), and it was enough to serve all query needs.
// But at the end of the day I ended up with some duplicate data, mostly references to user or agent.
// With more time in hands I would either remodel the tables, maybe using single table design, to allow for actual queryable references instead
// of duplication, or some async mechanism to deal with eventual consistency whenever user or agent would be updated.

> Authentication/Authorization

// Regarding authentication and authorization, in a real application I'd most likely use a JWT with roles/user data encoded into it.
// In the exercise I ended up querying the database for each request in order to validate the user's roles, since all we had was it's id.

> Specs

// I chose Jest as the testing framework, since it's the one i'm most comfortable with.
// To  be able to say that the app is production ready, i'd have to at least write a couple of unit test cases for every module.
// No time to do  that today, unfortunately, so i ended up with a couple of examples of how i'd do it :(
// Regarding integration tests, and being very honest, i haven't had the chance to work with it in the past,
// and it's a point of improvement i'd like to tackle in the near future
